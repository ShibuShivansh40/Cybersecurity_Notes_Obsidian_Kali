## Default WordPress File Structure

WordPress can be installed on a Windows, Linux, or Mac OSX host. For this module, we will focus on a default WordPress installation on an Ubuntu Linux web server. WordPress requires a fully installed and configured LAMP stack (Linux operating system, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and the PHP programming language) before installation on a Linux host. After installation, all WordPress supporting files and directories will be accessible in the webroot located atÂ `/var/www/html`.
