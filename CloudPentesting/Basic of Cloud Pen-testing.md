At first create a AWS Account and create a AWS S3 Bucket and add something into that like a file or something like that.

### Step - 1 : DNS Lookup
Now, here we want a simple DNS Check over the Cloud IP and for that we will be using the command: `nslookup <website.cloud>`

And when we take an IP from the given nslookup results and re-execute the command with that IP Address then, we can get to know the DNS Information about the IP and know what exactly the IP is referring to.

### Step - 3 : Downloading the Files from Cloud for Investigation
Now, to download the file, basically we will copy them into our local machine using the command : `aws s3 cp s3://<website.cloud>/filename --no-sign-request saving_name.html`
