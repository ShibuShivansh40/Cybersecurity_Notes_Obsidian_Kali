### Configuring CloudGate on AWS
To configure Cloud Gate on AWS, we need to first install Terraform on Kali Linux. To do that, download the AMD64 Binary on Kali and then run the below script:
```
cd Downloads
unzip <filename>.zip
terraform -h
sudo cp terrform /usr/local/bin
```
And now terraform is accessible wherever we call it.

Then we are required to install jq using the command : `sudo apt install jq` 
And to install the Git repository using as Python Library, we will use the command : `pipx install git+https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat.git `
```
┌──(shibushivansh㉿shibu)-[~/Scripts]
└─$ pipx install git+https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat.git
  installed package cloudgoat 2.3.1, installed using Python 3.13.9
  These apps are now globally available
    - cloudgoat
done! ✨ 🌟 ✨
```

Then we are required to create a user with some IAM Permissions. We'll go to Amazon Console > Users > Give Username > Attach Policy Directly > AdminstrativeAccess > Create User.

And then we will fetch the Access Key by creating them up.

Then use the command : `aws configure --profile shibu_cloadgoat` and enter the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
```
┌──(shibushivansh㉿shibu)-[~]
└─$ aws sts get-caller-identity --profile shibu_cloudgoat
{
    "UserId": "AIDA6AIOUUF2USO2KZCF6",
    "Account": "962640257397",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::962640257397:user/shibu_cloudgoat"
}

┌──(shibushivansh㉿shibu)-[~]
└─$ cloudgoat config aws
No configuration file was found at /home/shibushivansh/.local/share/pipx/venvs/cloudgoat/lib/python3.13/site-packages/cloudgoat/config.yml.
Would you like to create this file with a default aws setting now? [y/n]: y
Enter the name of your default AWS profile: shibu_cloudgoat
A default aws setting of "shibu_cloudgoat" has been saved.

┌──(shibushivansh㉿shibu)-[~]
└─$ cloudgoat config whitelist --auto
No whitelist.txt file was found at /home/shibushivansh/.local/share/pipx/venvs/cloudgoat/lib/python3.13/site-packages/cloudgoat/whitelist.txt

CloudGoat can automatically make a network request, using https://ifconfig.co to find your IP address, and then overwrite the contents of the whitelist file with the result.
Would you like to continue? [y/n]: y

whitelist.txt created with IP address 115.241.35.34/32

```

And using all these 3 commands, finally CloudGoat is installed and ready to work for us.
