**Organization** : The Organization resource is the root node in the Google Cloud resource hierarchy and is the hierarchical super node of projects.

**Folders** : Folders are nodes in the Cloud Platform Resource Hierarchy. A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both.

Organizations can use folders to group projects under the organization node in a hierarchy.

**Project** : A GCP Project is basically a collection of various GCP services such as compute instances, storage buckets, Cloud run containers, etc. that are grouped together since they serve one application or project in the corporate terminology.

### GCP Service Account
Equivalent to role in AWS and Managed Identities in Azure. By default service account never expire and did not have MFA. Very interesting account for attackers.

A service account is a special kind of account used by an application or GCP compute instance.

Service account act as a identity as well as a resource: - Service account as identity - Where we need GCP resource access without human intervention - Service account as resource - Where we need access on other service accounts –> Service account is associated within a project and uniquely identity by it’s email address.


### Default Service Account
- Automatically created within a project (Ex: User create a new compute instance)
	– App Engine: Default Service Account: PROJECT_ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
	– Compute Engine: Default Service Account: PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com

>The Compute Engine default service account is created with the IAM basic Editor role. They have this permission on Project level.


**User Managed Service Account** : 
- Created and managed by end user when required :  SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

To view their permissions you can copy theses managed service account role to a custom one. `gcloud iam roles copy`
