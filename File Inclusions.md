#### PHP

In `PHP`, we may use the `include()` function to load a local or a remote file as we load a page. If the `path` passed to the `include()` is taken from a user-controlled parameter, like a `GET` parameter, and `the code does not explicitly filter and sanitize the user input`, then the code becomes vulnerable to File Inclusion. The following code snippet shows an example of that:

Code: php

```php
if (isset($_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
}
```

> We see that the `language` parameter is directly passed to the `include()` function. So, any path we pass in the `language` parameter will be loaded on the page, including any local files on the back-end server. This is not exclusive to the `include()` function, as there are many other PHP functions that would lead to the same vulnerability if we had control over the path passed into them. Such functions include `include_once()`, `require()`, `require_once()`, `file_get_contents()`, and several others as well.


## Basic LFI

if the web application is indeed pulling a file that is now being included in the page, we may be able to change the file being pulled to read the content of a different local file. Two common readable files that are available on most back-end servers are `/etc/passwd` on Linux and `C:\Windows\boot.ini` on Windows.

We can easily bypass this restriction by traversing directories using `relative paths`. To do so, we can add `../` before our file name, which refers to the parent directory. For example, if the full path of the languages directory is `/var/www/html/languages/`, then using `../index.php` would refer to the `index.php` file on the parent directory (i.e. `/var/www/html/index.php`).

So, we can use this trick to go back several directories until we reach the root path (i.e. `/`), and then specify our absolute file path (e.g. `../../../../etc/passwd`), and the file should exist:

>**Tip:** It can always be useful to be efficient and not add unnecessary `../` several times, especially if we were writing a report or writing an exploit. So, always try to find the minimum number of `../` that works and use it. You may also be able to calculate how many directories you are away from the root path and use that many. For example, with `/var/www/html/` we are `3` directories away from the root path, so we can use `../` 3 times (i.e. `../../../`).

## Second-Order Attacks

As we can see, LFI attacks can come in different shapes. Another common, and a little bit more advanced, LFI attack is a `Second Order Attack`. This occurs because many web application functionalities may be insecurely pulling files from the back-end server based on user-controlled parameters.

For example, a web application may allow us to download our avatar through a URL like (`/profile/$username/avatar.png`). If we craft a malicious LFI username (e.g. `../../../etc/passwd`), then it may be possible to change the file being pulled to another local file on the server and grab it instead of our avatar.

In this case, we would be poisoning a database entry with a malicious LFI payload in our username. Then, another web application functionality would utilize this poisoned entry to perform our attack (i.e. download our avatar based on username value). This is why this attack is called a `Second-Order` attack.

Developers often overlook these vulnerabilities, as they may protect against direct user input (e.g. from a `?page` parameter), but they may trust values pulled from their database, like our username in this case. If we managed to poison our username during our registration, then the attack would be possible.

Exploiting LFI vulnerabilities using second-order attacks is similar to what we have discussed in this section. The only variance is that we need to spot a function that pulls a file based on a value we indirectly control and then try to control that value to exploit the vulnerability.

## Non-Recursive Path Traversal Filters

One of the most basic filters against LFI is a search and replace filter, where it simply deletes substrings of (`../`) to avoid path traversals. For example:
```php
$language = str_replace('../', '', $_GET['language']);
```

The above code is supposed to prevent path traversal, and hence renders LFI useless. If we try the LFI payloads we tried in the previous section, we get the following:
![Shipping containers and cranes at a port with PHP include error messages displayed.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/23/lfi_blacklist.png)

We see that all `../` substrings were removed, which resulted in a final path being `./languages/etc/passwd`. However, this filter is very insecure, as it is not `recursively removing` the `../` substring, as it runs a single time on the input string and does not apply the filter on the output string. For example, if we use `....//` as our payload, then the filter would remove `../` and the output string would be `../`, which means we may still perform path traversal. Let's try applying this logic to include `/etc/passwd` again:

![Shipping containers and cranes at a port with a list of system user accounts displayed.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/23/lfi_blacklist_passwd.png)

As we can see, the inclusion was successful this time, and we're able to read `/etc/passwd` successfully. The `....//` substring is not the only bypass we can use, as we may use `..././` or `....\/` and several other recursive LFI payloads. Furthermore, in some cases, escaping the forward slash character may also work to avoid path traversal filters (e.g. `....\/`), or adding extra forward slashes (e.g. `....////`)


## Encoding

Some web filters may prevent input filters that include certain LFI-related characters, like a dot `.` or a slash `/` used for path traversals. However, some of these filters may be bypassed by URL encoding our input, such that it would no longer include these bad characters, but would still be decoded back to our path traversal string once it reaches the vulnerable function. Core PHP filters on versions 5.3.4 and earlier were specifically vulnerable to this bypass, but even on newer versions we may find custom filters that may be bypassed through URL encoding.

If the target web application did not allow `.` and `/` in our input, we can URL encode `../` into `%2e%2e%2f`, which may bypass the filter. To do so, we can use any online URL encoder utility or use the Burp Suite Decoder tool, as follows: ![burp_url_encode](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/23/burp_url_encode.jpg)

**Note:** For this to work we must URL encode all characters, including the dots. Some URL encoders may not encode dots as they are considered to be part of the URL scheme.

Let's try to use this encoded LFI payload against our earlier vulnerable web application that filters `../` strings:

   

![Burp Suite Decoder showing path traversal input '../../etc/passwd' and its URL-encoded output.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/23/lfi_blacklist_passwd_filter.png)

As we can see, we were also able to successfully bypass the filter and use path traversal to read `/etc/passwd`. Furthermore, we may also use Burp Decoder to encode the encoded string once again to have a `double encoded` string, which may also bypass other types of filters.

#### Null Bytes

PHP versions before 5.5 were vulnerable to `null byte injection`, which means that adding a null byte (`%00`) at the end of the string would terminate the string and not consider anything after it. This is due to how strings are stored in low-level memory, where strings in memory must use a null byte to indicate the end of the string, as seen in Assembly, C, or C++ languages.

To exploit this vulnerability, we can end our payload with a null byte (e.g. `/etc/passwd%00`), such that the final path passed to `include()` would be (`/etc/passwd%00.php`). This way, even though `.php` is appended to our string, anything after the null byte would be truncated, and so the path used would actually be `/etc/passwd`, leading us to bypass the appended extension.
