#### PHP

In `PHP`, we may use the `include()` function to load a local or a remote file as we load a page. If the `path` passed to the `include()` is taken from a user-controlled parameter, like a `GET` parameter, and `the code does not explicitly filter and sanitize the user input`, then the code becomes vulnerable to File Inclusion. The following code snippet shows an example of that:

Code: php

```php
if (isset($_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
}
```

> We see that the `language` parameter is directly passed to the `include()` function. So, any path we pass in the `language` parameter will be loaded on the page, including any local files on the back-end server. This is not exclusive to the `include()` function, as there are many other PHP functions that would lead to the same vulnerability if we had control over the path passed into them. Such functions include `include_once()`, `require()`, `require_once()`, `file_get_contents()`, and several others as well.
