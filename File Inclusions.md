#### PHP

In `PHP`, we may use the `include()` function to load a local or a remote file as we load a page. If the `path` passed to the `include()` is taken from a user-controlled parameter, like a `GET` parameter, and `the code does not explicitly filter and sanitize the user input`, then the code becomes vulnerable to File Inclusion. The following code snippet shows an example of that:

Code: php

```php
if (isset($_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
}
```

> We see that the `language` parameter is directly passed to the `include()` function. So, any path we pass in the `language` parameter will be loaded on the page, including any local files on the back-end server. This is not exclusive to the `include()` function, as there are many other PHP functions that would lead to the same vulnerability if we had control over the path passed into them. Such functions include `include_once()`, `require()`, `require_once()`, `file_get_contents()`, and several others as well.


## Basic LFI

if the web application is indeed pulling a file that is now being included in the page, we may be able to change the file being pulled to read the content of a different local file. Two common readable files that are available on most back-end servers are `/etc/passwd` on Linux and `C:\Windows\boot.ini` on Windows.

We can easily bypass this restriction by traversing directories using `relative paths`. To do so, we can add `../` before our file name, which refers to the parent directory. For example, if the full path of the languages directory is `/var/www/html/languages/`, then using `../index.php` would refer to the `index.php` file on the parent directory (i.e. `/var/www/html/index.php`).

So, we can use this trick to go back several directories until we reach the root path (i.e. `/`), and then specify our absolute file path (e.g. `../../../../etc/passwd`), and the file should exist:

>**Tip:** It can always be useful to be efficient and not add unnecessary `../` several times, especially if we were writing a report or writing an exploit. So, always try to find the minimum number of `../` that works and use it. You may also be able to calculate how many directories you are away from the root path and use that many. For example, with `/var/www/html/` we are `3` directories away from the root path, so we can use `../` 3 times (i.e. `../../../`).
