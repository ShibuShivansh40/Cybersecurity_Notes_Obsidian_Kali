#### PHP

In `PHP`, we may use the `include()` function to load a local or a remote file as we load a page. If the `path` passed to the `include()` is taken from a user-controlled parameter, like a `GET` parameter, and `the code does not explicitly filter and sanitize the user input`, then the code becomes vulnerable to File Inclusion. The following code snippet shows an example of that:

Code: php

```php
if (isset($_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
}
```

> We see that the `language` parameter is directly passed to the `include()` function. So, any path we pass in the `language` parameter will be loaded on the page, including any local files on the back-end server. This is not exclusive to the `include()` function, as there are many other PHP functions that would lead to the same vulnerability if we had control over the path passed into them. Such functions include `include_once()`, `require()`, `require_once()`, `file_get_contents()`, and several others as well.


## Basic LFI

if the web application is indeed pulling a file that is now being included in the page, we may be able to change the file being pulled to read the content of a different local file. Two common readable files that are available on most back-end servers are `/etc/passwd` on Linux and `C:\Windows\boot.ini` on Windows.

We can easily bypass this restriction by traversing directories using `relative paths`. To do so, we can add `../` before our file name, which refers to the parent directory. For example, if the full path of the languages directory is `/var/www/html/languages/`, then using `../index.php` would refer to the `index.php` file on the parent directory (i.e. `/var/www/html/index.php`).

So, we can use this trick to go back several directories until we reach the root path (i.e. `/`), and then specify our absolute file path (e.g. `../../../../etc/passwd`), and the file should exist:

>**Tip:** It can always be useful to be efficient and not add unnecessary `../` several times, especially if we were writing a report or writing an exploit. So, always try to find the minimum number of `../` that works and use it. You may also be able to calculate how many directories you are away from the root path and use that many. For example, with `/var/www/html/` we are `3` directories away from the root path, so we can use `../` 3 times (i.e. `../../../`).

## Second-Order Attacks

As we can see, LFI attacks can come in different shapes. Another common, and a little bit more advanced, LFI attack is a `Second Order Attack`. This occurs because many web application functionalities may be insecurely pulling files from the back-end server based on user-controlled parameters.

For example, a web application may allow us to download our avatar through a URL like (`/profile/$username/avatar.png`). If we craft a malicious LFI username (e.g. `../../../etc/passwd`), then it may be possible to change the file being pulled to another local file on the server and grab it instead of our avatar.

In this case, we would be poisoning a database entry with a malicious LFI payload in our username. Then, another web application functionality would utilize this poisoned entry to perform our attack (i.e. download our avatar based on username value). This is why this attack is called a `Second-Order` attack.

Developers often overlook these vulnerabilities, as they may protect against direct user input (e.g. from a `?page` parameter), but they may trust values pulled from their database, like our username in this case. If we managed to poison our username during our registration, then the attack would be possible.

Exploiting LFI vulnerabilities using second-order attacks is similar to what we have discussed in this section. The only variance is that we need to spot a function that pulls a file based on a value we indirectly control and then try to control that value to exploit the vulnerability.
