|Method|Description|Example|Best Used When...|
|---|---|---|---|
|`Simple Brute Force`|Systematically tries all possible combinations of characters within a defined character set and length range.|Trying all combinations of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' for passwords of length 4 to 6.|No prior information about the password is available, and computational resources are abundant.|
|`Dictionary Attack`|Uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and passwords.|Trying passwords from a list like 'rockyou.txt' against a login form.|The target will likely use a weak or easily guessable password based on common patterns.|
|`Hybrid Attack`|Combines elements of simple brute force and dictionary attacks, often appending or prepending characters to dictionary words.|Adding numbers or special characters to the end of words from a dictionary list.|The target might use a slightly modified version of a common password.|
|`Credential Stuffing`|Leverages leaked credentials from one service to attempt access to other services, assuming users reuse passwords.|Using a list of usernames and passwords leaked from a data breach to try logging into various online accounts.|A large set of leaked credentials is available, and the target is suspected of reusing passwords across multiple services.|
|`Password Spraying`|Attempts a small set of commonly used passwords against a large number of usernames.|Trying passwords like 'password123' or 'qwerty' against all usernames in an organization.|Account lockout policies are in place, and the attacker aims to avoid detection by spreading attempts across multiple accounts.|
|`Rainbow Table Attack`|Uses pre-computed tables of password hashes to reverse hashes and recover plaintext passwords quickly.|Pre-computing hashes for all possible passwords of a certain length and character set, then comparing captured hashes against the table to find matches.|A large number of password hashes need to be cracked, and storage space for the rainbow tables is available.|
|`Reverse Brute Force`|Targets a single password against multiple usernames, often used in conjunction with credential stuffing attacks.|Using a leaked password from one service to try logging into multiple accounts with different usernames.|A strong suspicion exists that a particular password is being reused across multiple accounts.|
|`Distributed Brute Force`|Distributes the brute forcing workload across multiple computers or devices to accelerate the process.|Using a cluster of computers to perform a brute-force attack significantly increases the number of combinations that can be tried per second.|The target password or key is highly complex, and a single machine lacks the computational power to crack it within a reasonable timeframe.|

|Wordlist|Description|Typical Use|Source|
|---|---|---|---|
|`rockyou.txt`|A popular password wordlist containing millions of passwords leaked from the RockYou breach.|Commonly used for password brute force attacks.|[RockYou breach dataset](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt)|
|`top-usernames-shortlist.txt`|A concise list of the most common usernames.|Suitable for quick brute force username attempts.|[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt)|
|`xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt`|A more extensive list of 10 million usernames.|Used for thorough username brute forcing.|[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt)|
|`2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt`|A list of the 200 most commonly used passwords as of 2023.|Effective for targeting commonly reused passwords.|[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt)|
|`Default-Credentials/default-passwords.txt`|A list of default usernames and passwords commonly used in routers, software, and other devices.|Ideal for trying default credentials.|[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials/default-passwords.txt)|
