# Web Services Description Language (WSDL)

WSDL stands for Web Service Description Language. WSDL is an XML-based file exposed by web services that informs clients of the provided services/methods, including where they reside and the method-calling convention.

A web service's WSDL file should not always be accessible. Developers may not want to publicly expose a web service's WSDL file, or they may expose it through an uncommon location, following a security through obscurity approach. In the latter case, directory/parameter fuzzing may reveal the location and content of a WSDL file.

To search for the WSDL File we can take the help of Dirb using the command : `dirb http://<TARGET IP>:3002`

If  this file exists and if we can't directly cURL it, so we can try to fuzz parameters into it using the command : `ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt -u 'http://<TARGET IP>:3002/wsdl?FUZZ' -fs 0 -mc 200`

> **Note**: WSDL files can be found in many forms, such as `/example.wsdl`, `?wsdl`, `/example.disco`, `?disco` etc. [DISCO](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2002/february/xml-files-publishing-and-discovering-web-services-with-disco-and-uddi) is a Microsoft technology for publishing and discovering Web Services.

```shell-session
ffuf -w "/home/htb-acxxxxx/Desktop/Useful Repos/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt" -u 'http://<TARGET IP>:3003/?FUZZ=test_value' -fs 19
```
This is the command to search for the parameters used by the Website.

Brute-forcing API Requests using the Python Code : 
```python
import requests, sys

def brute():
    try:
        value = range(10000)
        for val in value:
            url = sys.argv[1]
            r = requests.get(url + '/?id='+str(val))
            if "position" in r.text:
                print("Number found!", val)
                print(r.text)
    except IndexError:
        print("Enter a URL E.g.: http://<TARGET IP>:3003/")

brute()
```
