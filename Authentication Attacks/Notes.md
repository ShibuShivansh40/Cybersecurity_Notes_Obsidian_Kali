**Session Management** is a process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it. This is required for a server to remember how to react to subsequent requests throughout a transaction. Sessions are maintained on the server by a session identifier which can be passed back and forth between the client and server when transmitting and receiving requests. Sessions should be unique per user and computationally very difficult to predict.

Password Length
- **Minimum** length for passwords should be enforced by the application. Passwords **shorter than 8 characters** are considered to be weak ([NIST SP800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)).
- **Maximum** password length should be **at least 64 characters** to allow passphrases ([NIST SP800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)). Note that certain implementations of hashing algorithms may cause [long password denial of service](https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/long-password-denial-of-service/).

> By sending a very long password (1.000.000 characters) it's possible to cause a denial a service attack on the server. This may lead to the website becoming unavailable or unresponsive. Usually this problem is caused by a vulnerable password hashing implementation. When a long password is sent, the password hashing process will result in CPU and memory exhaustion.

Block common and previously breached passwords
- [Pwned Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) is a service where passwords can be checked against previously breached passwords. Details on the API [are here](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords).
- Alternatively, you can download the [Pwned Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) database [using this mechanism](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/PwnedPasswordsDownloader?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-haveibeenpwned-downloader) to host it yourself.
- Other top password lists are available but there is no guarantee as to how updated they are:
    - [Various password lists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords) hosted by SecLists from Daniel Miessler.
    - Static copy of the top 100,000 passwords from "Have I Been Pwned" hosted by NCSC in [text](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/PwnedPasswordsTop100k.txt) and [JSON](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/PwnedPasswordsTop100k.json) format.

#### Authentication Responses[¶](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#authentication-responses "Permanent link")
Using any of the authentication mechanisms (login, password reset, or password recovery), an application must respond with a generic error message regardless of whether:

- The user ID or password was incorrect.
- The account does not exist.
- The account is locked or disabled.

The account registration feature should also be taken into consideration, and the same approach of a generic error message can be applied regarding the case in which the user exists.

The objective is to prevent the creation of a [discrepancy factor](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/204.html), allowing an attacker to mount a user enumeration action against the application.

It is interesting to note that the business logic itself can bring a discrepancy factor related to the processing time taken. Indeed, depending on the implementation, the processing time can be significantly different according to the case (success vs failure) allowing an attacker to mount a [time-based attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack) (delta of some seconds for example).

#### CAPTCHA[¶](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#captcha "Permanent link")
The use of an effective CAPTCHA can help to prevent automated login attempts against accounts. However, many CAPTCHA implementations have weaknesses that allow them to be solved using automated techniques or can be outsourced to services that can solve them. As such, the use of CAPTCHA should be viewed as a defense-in-depth control to make brute-force attacks more time-consuming and expensive, rather than as a preventative.

It may be more user-friendly to only require a CAPTCHA be solved after a small number of failed login attempts, rather than requiring it from the very first login.

### SAML[¶](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#saml "Permanent link")
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is often considered to compete with OpenId. The most recommended version is 2.0 since it is very feature-complete and provides strong security. Like OpenId, SAML uses identity providers, but unlike OpenId, it is XML-based and provides more flexibility. SAML is based on browser redirects which send XML data. Furthermore, SAML isn't only initiated by a service provider; it can also be initiated from the identity provider. This allows the user to navigate through different portals while still being authenticated without having to do anything, making the process transparent.

While OpenId has taken most of the consumer market, SAML is often the choice for enterprise applications because there are few OpenId identity providers which are considered enterprise-class (meaning that the way they validate the user identity doesn't have high standards required for enterprise identity). It is more common to see SAML being used inside of intranet websites, sometimes even using a server from the intranet as the identity provider.

In the past few years, applications like SAP ERP and SharePoint (SharePoint by using Active Directory Federation Services 2.0) have decided to use SAML 2.0 authentication as an often preferred method for single sign-on implementations whenever enterprise federation is required for web services and web applications.
