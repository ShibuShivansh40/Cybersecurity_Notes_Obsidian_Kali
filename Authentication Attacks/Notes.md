**Session Management** is a process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it. This is required for a server to remember how to react to subsequent requests throughout a transaction. Sessions are maintained on the server by a session identifier which can be passed back and forth between the client and server when transmitting and receiving requests. Sessions should be unique per user and computationally very difficult to predict.

Password Length
- **Minimum** length for passwords should be enforced by the application. Passwords **shorter than 8 characters** are considered to be weak ([NIST SP800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)).
- **Maximum** password length should be **at least 64 characters** to allow passphrases ([NIST SP800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)). Note that certain implementations of hashing algorithms may cause [long password denial of service](https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/long-password-denial-of-service/).

> By sending a very long password (1.000.000 characters) it's possible to cause a denial a service attack on the server. This may lead to the website becoming unavailable or unresponsive. Usually this problem is caused by a vulnerable password hashing implementation. When a long password is sent, the password hashing process will result in CPU and memory exhaustion.
