A session identifier's security level depends on its:

- `Validity Scope` (a secure session identifier should be valid for one session only)
- `Randomness` (a secure session identifier should be generated through a robust random number/string generation algorithm so that it cannot be predicted)
- `Validity Time` (a secure session identifier should expire after a certain amount of time)
