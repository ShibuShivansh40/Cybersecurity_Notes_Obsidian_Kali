## What is clickjacking?

Clickjacking is an interface-based attack in which a user is tricked into clicking on actionable content on a hidden website by clicking on some other content in a decoy website. Consider the following example:

A web user accesses a decoy website (perhaps this is a link provided by an email) and clicks on a button to win a prize. Unknowingly, they have been deceived by an attacker into pressing an alternative hidden button and this results in the payment of an account on another site. This is an example of a clickjacking attack. The technique depends upon the incorporation of an invisible, actionable web page (or multiple pages) containing a button or hidden link, say, within an iframe. The iframe is overlaid on top of the user's anticipated decoy web page content. This attack differs from a CSRF attack in that the user is required to perform an action such as a button click whereas a CSRF attack depends upon forging an entire request without the user's knowledge or input.

## How to construct a basic clickjacking attack

Clickjacking attacks use CSS to create and manipulate layers. The attacker incorporates the target website as an iframe layer overlaid on the decoy website. An example using the style tag and parameters is as follows:

`<head> <style> #target_website { position:relative; width:128px; height:128px; opacity:0.00001; z-index:2; } #decoy_website { position:absolute; width:300px; height:400px; z-index:1; } </style> </head> ... <body> <div id="decoy_website"> ...decoy web content here... </div> <iframe id="target_website" src="https://vulnerable-website.com"> </iframe> </body>`
