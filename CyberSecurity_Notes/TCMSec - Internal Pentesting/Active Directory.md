## Introduction - AD
- Developed by Microsoft to manage Windows domain network
- "Phone book for Windows"
- Authenticates using Kerberos Tickets.
- Non-Windows Devices can be authenticated to AD via RADIUS or LDAP

DS  -Domain Services
# Physical AD Components
### Domain Controllers
A domain controller is a server with the AD DS Server Roles installed that has specifically been promoted to a domain controller.
- Host a copy of the AD DS Directory Store
- Provide authentication and authorization services
- Replicate updates to other domain controllers in the domain and forest
- Allow administrative access to manage user accounts and network resources.

## AD DS Data Store
The AD DS Data Store contains the database files and processes that store and manage directory information for users, services and applications.
 - Consists of the Ntds.dit file
 - Is stored by default in the `%SystemRoot%\NTDS `folder on all domain controllers.
 - Is accessible only through the domain controller processes and protocols.

# Logical AD Components
## AD DS Schema
- Defines every type of object that can be stored in the directory
- Enforces rules regarding object creation and configuration

## Domains
Domains are used to group and manage objects in the organization.
- An administrative boundary for applying policies to group of objects
- A replication boundary for replicating data between domain controllers.
- An authentication and authorization boundary that provides a way to limit the scope of access to resources.

## Tree
A domain tree is a hierarchy of domains in AD DS.
- Share a contiguous namespace with the parent domain
- Can have additional child domains
- By default create a 2-way transitive trust with other domains

## Forests
A forest is a collection of one or more domain trees.
- Share a common schema
- Share a common configuration partition
- Share a common global catalog to enable searching
- Enable trusts between all domains in the forest
- Share the Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins groups

## Organizational Units (OUs)
OUs are AD Containers that can contain users, groups, computers and other OUs.
- Represent your organization hierarchically and logically 
- Manage a collection of objects in a consistent way
- Delegate permissions to administer group of objects
- Apply Policies

## Trusts
Trusts provide a mechanism for users to gain access to resources in another domain.

- All domains in a forest trust all other domains in the forest
- Trusts can extend outside the forest.
