#### Knowledge

Authentication based on knowledge factors relies on something that the user knows to prove their identity. The user provides information such as passwords, passphrases, PINs, or answers to security questions.

#### Ownership

Authentication based on ownership factors relies on something the user possesses. The user proves their identity by proving the ownership of a physical object or device, such as ID cards, security tokens, or smartphones with authentication apps. 

#### Inherence

Lastly, authentication based on inherence factors relies on something the user is or does. This includes biometric factors such as fingerprints, facial patterns, and voice recognition, or signatures. Biometric authentication is highly effective since biometric traits are inherently tied to an individual user.
